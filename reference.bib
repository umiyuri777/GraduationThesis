abstract = {Context: Software projects often have four objectives; to produce the required functionality, in budget and in schedule, with acceptable quality. That statement may be true for most of the ordinary software development projects, but are these objectives enough for game development, where creativity and artistic aspects have a major role? Goal: We analyze how game developing organizations test their products, what are their main test objectives and how they perceive themselves in the software business. Method: We interviewed seven game development teams from different companies and studied how they test their products with grounded theory approach. Results: Our results suggest that game developers focus on soft values such as game content or user experience, instead of more traditional objectives such as reliability or efficiency. Conclusions: Game developers have similar, but not fully comparable to software industry, set of priorities in their software testing and quality assurance approaches.},

abstract = {Video games make up an important part of the software industry, yet the software engineering community rarely studies video games. This imbalance is a problem if video game development differs from general software development, as some game experts suggest. In this paper we describe a study with 14 interviewees and 364 survey respondents. The study elicited substantial differences between video game development and other software development. For example, in game development, “cowboy coders” are necessary to cope with the continuous interplay between creative desires and technical constraints. Consequently, game developers are hesitant to use automated testing because of these tests’ rapid obsolescence in the face of shifting creative desires of game designers. These differences between game and non-game development have implications for research, industry, and practice. For instance, as a starting point for impacting game development, researchers could create testing tools that enable game developers to create tests that assert flexible behavior with little up-front investment.},

abstract = {Autonomous agents have made great strides in specialist domains like Atari games and Go. However, they typically learn tabula rasa in isolated environments with limited and manually conceived objectives, thus failing to generalize across a wide spectrum of tasks and capabilities. Inspired by how humans continually learn and adapt in the open world, we advocate a trinity of ingredients for building generalist agents: 1) an environment that supports a multitude of tasks and goals, 2) a large-scale database of multimodal knowledge, and 3) a flexible and scalable agent architecture. We introduce MINEDOJO, a new framework built on the popular Minecraft game that features a simulation suite with thousands of diverse open-ended tasks and an internet-scale knowledge base with Minecraft videos, tutorials, wiki pages, and forum discussions. Using MINEDOJO's data, we propose a novel agent learning algorithm that leverages large pre-trained video-language models as a learned reward function. Our agent is able to solve a variety of open-ended tasks specified in free-form language without any manually designed dense shaping reward. We open-source the simulation suite, knowledge bases, algorithm implementation, and pretrained models (https://minedojo.org) to promote research towards the goal of generally capable embodied agents.},

abstract = {Autonomous driving systems (ADS) have achieved spectacular development and have been utilized in numerous safety-critical tasks. Nonetheless, in spite of their considerable advancement, ADS perception components with high complexity and low interpretability often demonstrate unexpected corner-case behaviors. Several real-world accidents involving self-driving cars even lead to fatalities. Before rolling the autonomous vehicles out to the end-users, it is vital to test and guarantee the safety of ADS. As one of the most critical autonomous driving testing techniques, the prevailing virtual testing depends on the tester using tool-specific languages to code traffic simulation programs correctly. However, this process often requires plenty of effort, and it may fail to capture various rare events from complex driving situations that require sophisticated awareness of the surroundings. In this paper, we design and implement a semantic-guided scene fuzzing framework for autonomous driving systems, namely FuzzScene, based on the metamorphic testing theory. It employs driving scenario description language for scenario representation and equips a tree-based mutation strategy to generate tests with proper oracle information. To improve the testing efficiency and detect misbehaviors under different settings, we propose a unique sampling strategy and construct a testing guidance criterion to optimize FuzzScene. We experiment FuzzScene with multiple steering controllers to evaluate its performance on different tasks. The experiment results show that the semantic transformed driving scenarios generated by FuzzScene efficiently detect hundreds of inconsistent behaviors of ADS. Also, the results confirm that FuzzScene can improve steering precision by retraining with the generated scenes.}

abstract = {A fundamental challenge of software testing is the statistically well-grounded extrapolation from program behaviors observed during testing. For instance, a security researcher who has run the fuzzer for a week has currently no means (1)&nbsp;to estimate the total number of feasible program branches, given that only a fraction has been covered so far; (2)&nbsp;to estimate the additional time required to cover 10\% more branches (or to estimate the coverage achieved in one more day, respectively); or (3)&nbsp;to assess the residual risk that a vulnerability exists when no vulnerability has been discovered. Failing to discover a vulnerability does not mean that none exists—even if the fuzzer was run for a week (or a year). Hence, testing provides no formal correctness guarantees.In this article, I establish an unexpected connection with the otherwise unrelated scientific field of ecology and introduce a statistical framework that models Software Testing and Analysis as Discovery of Species (STADS). For instance, in order to study the species diversity of arthropods in a tropical rain forest, ecologists would first sample a large number of individuals from that forest, determine their species, and extrapolate from the properties observed in the sample to properties of the whole forest. The estimations (1)&nbsp;of the total number of species, (2)&nbsp;of the additional sampling effort required to discover 10\% more species, or (3)&nbsp;of the probability to discover a new species are classical problems in ecology. The STADS framework draws from over three decades of research in ecological biostatistics to address the fundamental extrapolation challenge for automated test generation. Our preliminary empirical study demonstrates a good estimator performance even for a fuzzer with adaptive sampling bias—AFL, a state-of-the-art vulnerability detection tool. The STADS framework provides statistical correctness guarantees with quantifiable accuracy.},

abstract = {Open world games present players with more freedom than games with linear progression structures. However, without clearly-defined objectives, they often leave players without a sense of purpose. Most of the time, quests and objectives are hand-authored and overlaid atop an open world's mechanics. But what if they could be generated organically from the gameplay itself? The goal of our project was to develop a model of the mechanics in Minecraft that could be used to determine the ideal placement of objectives in an open world setting. We formalized the game logic of Minecraft in terms of logical rules that can be manipulated in two ways: they may be executed to generate graphs representative of the player experience when playing an open world game with little developer direction; and they may be statically analyzed to determine dependency orderings, feedback loops, and bottlenecks. These analyses may then be used to place achievements on gameplay actions algorithmically.},
